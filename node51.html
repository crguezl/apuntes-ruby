Constantes Racionales en Ruby 2.1</A>

You might be aware that floats are far from ideal when doing calculations with fixed decimal points:
<PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim291#</PRE>
A lot of Ruby developers fall back to using integers and only fixing
it when displaying the result. 

<P>
However, this only works well if you
have indeed have fixed decimal points. 

<P>
If not, you have to use
rationals. Which isn't too bad, except there was no nice syntax for
them (short of changing the return value of <tex2html_verb_mark>120<tex2html_verb_mark>).

<P>
Ruby 2.1 introduces the <tex2html_verb_mark>121<tex2html_verb_mark> 
suffix for decimal/rational literals to fix this:
<PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim292#</PRE>

<P>
