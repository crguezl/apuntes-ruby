Manejo de Excepciones</A>

<P>
An exception is an object that represents some kind of exceptional
condition; it indicates that something has gone wrong. This could
be a programming error—attempting to divide by zero, attempting to
invoke a method on an object that does not define the method, or
passing an invalid argument to a method. Or it could be the result
from some kind of external condition—making a network request when
the network is down, or trying to create an object when the system
is out of memory.

<P>
When one of these errors or conditions occurs, an exception is
<tex2html_verb_mark>244<tex2html_verb_mark>d (or <tex2html_verb_mark>245<tex2html_verb_mark>n). By default, Ruby programs terminate when an
exception occurs. But it is possible to declare exception handlers.
An exception handler is a block of code that is executed if an
exception occurs during the execution of some other block of code.
In this sense, exceptions are a kind of control statement. Raising
an exception transfers the flow-of-control to exception handling
code. This is like using the <tex2html_verb_mark>246<tex2html_verb_mark> statement to exit from a loop.
As we’ll see, though, exceptions are quite different from the <tex2html_verb_mark>247<tex2html_verb_mark>
statement; they may transfer control out of many enclosing blocks
and even up the call stack in order to reach the exception handler.

<P>
Ruby uses the Kernel method <tex2html_verb_mark>248<tex2html_verb_mark> to <tex2html_verb_mark>249<tex2html_verb_mark> exceptions, and uses a
<tex2html_verb_mark>250<tex2html_verb_mark> clause to handle exceptions. Exceptions <tex2html_verb_mark>251<tex2html_verb_mark>d by <tex2html_verb_mark>252<tex2html_verb_mark> are
instances of the Exception class or one of its many subclasses. The
<tex2html_verb_mark>253<tex2html_verb_mark> and <tex2html_verb_mark>254<tex2html_verb_mark> methods described earlier in this chapter are not
intended to signal and handle exceptions, but a symbol thrown by
<tex2html_verb_mark>255<tex2html_verb_mark> propagates in the same way that an exception <tex2html_verb_mark>256<tex2html_verb_mark>d by <tex2html_verb_mark>257<tex2html_verb_mark>
does. Exception objects, exception propagation, the <tex2html_verb_mark>258<tex2html_verb_mark> method,
and the <tex2html_verb_mark>259<tex2html_verb_mark> clause are described in detail in the subsections
that follow.

<P>
