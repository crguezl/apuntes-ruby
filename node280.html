In computer programming, <A NAME="11257"><tex2html_anchor_invisible_mark></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">event-driven programming</SPAN> (<A NAME="11259"><tex2html_anchor_invisible_mark></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">EDP</SPAN>) or <A NAME="11261"><tex2html_anchor_invisible_mark></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">event-based programming</SPAN> is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events—e.g., sensor outputs or user actions (mouse clicks, key presses) or messages from other programs or threads.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Event-driven programming can also be defined as an application architecture technique in which the application has a main loop which is clearly divided down to two sections:
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL>
<LI>the first is <A NAME="11263"><tex2html_anchor_invisible_mark></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">event selection</SPAN> (or event detection)
</LI>
<LI>the second is <A NAME="11265"><tex2html_anchor_invisible_mark></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">event handling</SPAN>.
</LI>
</OL><BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In <A NAME="11267"><tex2html_anchor_invisible_mark></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">embedded systems</SPAN> the same may be achieved using interrupts instead of a constantly running main loop; 
in that case the former portion of the architecture resides completely in computer hardware. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Event-driven programming is similar to <A NAME="11269"><tex2html_anchor_invisible_mark></A><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">data-driven programming</SPAN>, in that both are structured as pattern matching and resulting processing, though they are typically applied to different domains.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Event-driven programs can be written in any language, although the task is easier in languages that provide high-level abstractions, such as closures

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Within an event-based application, everything must be non-blocking
to get the real benefit of event-based programming. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The event-loop
is running in a single thread within a single process. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore,
the first time you do something that is blocking, it causes the
whole event loop to stop and wait for you. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That means while you are
talking to you database for <#11161#><I>just 10 milliseconds</I><#11161#>, nothing else
happens. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You would be surprised at how many operations you can
perform in those 10ms of halting your entire event loop. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In that
time, potentially hundreds of connections, that only hit RAM, could
have come and gone, but instead they get queued waiting for your
blocking action.
