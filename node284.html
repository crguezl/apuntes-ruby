  HREF="http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org/">Event::Machine</A><#11231#><#11231#>’s Deferrable borrows heavily from the deferred object
in Python’s Twisted event-handling framework. Here’s a minimal
example that illustrates Deferrable:

<P>
<PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim1208#</PRE>

<P>
This program will spin for two seconds, print out the string 
<tex2html_verb_mark>1270<tex2html_verb_mark> and then exit. 

<P>
The Deferrable pattern allows you to specify any number of Ruby
code blocks (callbacks or errbacks) that will be executed at some
future time when the status of the Deferrable object changes.

<P>
How might that be useful? 

<OL>
<LI>Well, imagine that you’re implementing
an HTTP server, 
</LI>
<LI>but you need to make a call to some other server
in order to fulfill a client request.
</LI>
<LI>When you receive a request from one of your clients, you can create
and return a Deferrable object.
</LI>
<LI>Some other section of your program
can add a callback to the Deferrable that will cause the client’s
request to be fulfilled.
</LI>
<LI>Simultaneously, you initiate an event-driven
or threaded client request to some different server. 
</LI>
<LI>And then your
EM program will continue to process other events and service other
client requests.
</LI>
<LI>When your client request to the other server completes some time
later, you will call the <tex2html_verb_mark>1271<tex2html_verb_mark> method on the Deferrable
object, passing either a <tex2html_verb_mark>1272<tex2html_verb_mark> or <tex2html_verb_mark>1273<tex2html_verb_mark> status, and an arbitrary
number of parameters (which might include the data you received
from the other server).
</LI>
<LI>At that point, the status of the Deferrable object becomes known,
and its callback or errback methods are immediately executed.
</LI>
<LI>Callbacks and errbacks are code blocks that are attached to Deferrable
objects at any time through the methods callback and errback.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The deep beauty of this pattern is that it decouples the disposition
of one operation (such as a client request to an outboard server)
from the subsequent operations that depend on that disposition
(which may include responding to a different client or any other
operation).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The code which invokes the deferred operation (that will eventually
result in a success or failure status together with associated data)
is completely separate from the code which depends on that status
and data. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>This achieves one of the primary goals for which threading
is typically used in sophisticated applications, with none of the
nondeterminacy or debugging difficulties of threads.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>As soon as the deferred status of a Deferrable becomes known by way
of a call to <tex2html_verb_mark>1274<tex2html_verb_mark>, the Deferrable will IMMEDIATELY
execute all of its callbacks or errbacks in the order in which they
were added to the Deferrable.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Callbacks and errbacks can be added to a Deferrable object at any
time, not just when the object is created. They can even be added
after the status of the object has been determined! (In this case,
they will be executed immediately when they are added.)

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A call to <tex2html_verb_mark>1275<tex2html_verb_mark> takes <tex2html_verb_mark>1276<tex2html_verb_mark> 
or <tex2html_verb_mark>1277<tex2html_verb_mark>
as its first argument. (This determines whether the object will
call its callbacks or its errbacks.) <tex2html_verb_mark>1278<tex2html_verb_mark> also takes
zero or more additional parameters, that will in turn be passed as
parameters to the callbacks or errbacks.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>In general, you can only call <tex2html_verb_mark>1279<tex2html_verb_mark> ONCE on a Deferrable
object. A call to <tex2html_verb_mark>1280<tex2html_verb_mark> will not return until all of
the associated callbacks or errbacks have been called. If you add
callbacks or errbacks AFTER making a call to <tex2html_verb_mark>1281<tex2html_verb_mark>,
those additional callbacks or errbacks will execute IMMEDIATELY.
Any given callback or errback will be executed AT MOST once.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>It’s possible to call <tex2html_verb_mark>1282<tex2html_verb_mark> AGAIN, during the
execution a callback or errback. This makes it possible to change
the parameters which will be sent to the callbacks or errbacks
farther down the chain, enabling some extremely elegant use-cases.
You can transform the data returned from a deferred operation in
arbitrary ways as needed by subsequent users, without changing any
of the code that generated the original data.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A call to <tex2html_verb_mark>1283<tex2html_verb_mark> will not return until all of
the associated callbacks or errbacks have been called. If you add
callbacks or errbacks AFTER making a call to <tex2html_verb_mark>1284<tex2html_verb_mark>,
those additional callbacks or errbacks will execute IMMEDIATELY.
</LI>

DefaultDeferrable is an otherwise empty class that includes Deferrable. 

<P>
This is useful when you just need to return a Deferrable object 
as a way of communicating deferred status to some other part of a program.
