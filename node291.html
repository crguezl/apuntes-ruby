Celluloid</A>

Celluloid provides a simple and natural way to build fault-tolerant
concurrent programs in Ruby. With Celluloid, you can build systems out
of concurrent objects just as easily as you build sequential
programs out of regular objects. 

<P>
Much of the difficulty with building concurrent programs in Ruby arises
because the object-oriented mechanisms for structuring code, such as
classes and inheritance, are separate from the concurrency
mechanisms, such as threads and locks. Celluloid combines these into a
single structure, an active object running within a thread, called an
;SPMquot;actor;SPMquot;, or in Celluloid vernacular, a ;SPMquot;cell;SPMquot;.

<P>
The Actor Model can be summarized as follows:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Actors communicate by sending messages
</LI>
<LI>Every actor has a mailbox with a unique address. 
</LI>
<LI>If you have an actor's address, you can send it messages
</LI>
<LI>Actors can create other actors, and when they do they know their address so they can send the newly-created actors messages
</LI>
<LI>Actors can pass addresses (or handles) to themselves or other actors in messages
</LI>
</OL>
