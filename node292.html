Objects can message objects transparently that live on other machines over the network, and you don't have to worry about the networking gunk, and you don't have to worry about finding them, and you don't have to worry about anything. It's just as if you messaged an object that's right next door.

DCell is a simple and easy way to build distributed applications
in Ruby. Somewhat similar to DRb, DCell lets you easily expose Ruby
objects as network services, and call them remotely just like you
would any other Ruby object. However, unlike DRb all objects in the
system are concurrent. You can create and register several available
services on a given node, obtain handles to them, and easily pass
these handles around the network just like any other objects.

<P>
DCell is a distributed extension to Celluloid, which provides
concurrent objects for Ruby with many of the features of Erlang,
such as the ability to supervise objects and restart them when they
crash, and also link to other objects and receive event notifications
of when they crash. This makes it easier to build robust, fault-tolerant
distributed systems.

<P>
DCell uses the 0MQ messaging protocol which provides a robust,
fault-tolerant brokerless transport for asynchronous messages sent
between nodes. DCell is built on top of the Celluloid::ZMQ library,
which provides a Celluloid-oriented wrapper around the underlying
ffi-rzmq library.

To configure an individual DCell node, we need to give it a node
ID and a 0MQ address to bind to. Node IDs look like domain names,
and 0MQ addresses look like URLs that start with tcp:

To create a cluster, we need to start another Ruby VM and connect
it to the first VM.

Once you have a cluster of multiple nodes, you
can bootstrap additional nodes into the cluster by pointing them
at any node, and all nodes will gossip about the newly added node.
