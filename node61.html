Objects of most
classes need to be explicitly created, and this is most often done
with a method named new:

<P>
<PRE><tex2html_verbatim_mark>verbatim299#</PRE>

<P>
 <#3517#><TT>new</TT><#3517#>  is a method of the <A NAME="tex2html149"
  HREF="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Class.html"><TT>Class</TT></A><#3153#><#3153#> class. 

<P>

<OL>
<LI>It allocates memory to hold the
new object, then it initializes the state of that newly allocated
<#3155#><I>empty</I><#3155#> object by invoking its  <#3521#><TT>initialize</TT><#3521#>  method. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The arguments to
new are passed directly on to initialize. Most classes define an
initialize method to perform whatever initialization is necessary
for instances.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The new and initialize methods provide the default technique for
creating new objects, but classes may also define other methods,
known as <#3157#><I>factory methods</I><#3157#> that return instances. 

<P>

<LI>Ruby objects never need to be explicitly deallocated, as they do
in languages like C and C++. Ruby uses a technique called 
<A NAME="3522"><tex2html_anchor_invisible_mark></A><SPAN  CLASS="textit">garbage collection</SPAN> to automatically destroy objects that are no longer
needed. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>An object becomes a candidate for garbage collection when
it is unreachable: when there are no remaining references to the
object except from other unreachable objects.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Garbage collection does not mean that memory leaks are impossible:
any code that creates long-lived references to objects that would
otherwise be short-lived can be a
source of memory leaks.
